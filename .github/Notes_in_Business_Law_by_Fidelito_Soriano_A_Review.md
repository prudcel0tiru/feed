## Some Current Issues and Trends in Business Law
 
Aside from the basic and essential topics and concepts in business law, there are also some current issues and trends that business owners and entrepreneurs should be aware of. These include the following:
 
- The Comprehensive Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (CREATE) Act (Republic Act 11534) â this is a new law that aims to provide tax relief and incentives to businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. It lowers the corporate income tax rate from 30 percent to 25 percent (or 20 percent for small businesses) retroactive to July 1, 2020. It also grants income tax holidays and special tax rates to registered enterprises engaged in strategic investment priority activities[^1^].
- The Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act of 2018 (Republic Act 11032) â this is a law that aims to simplify and streamline the processes and requirements for starting and operating a business in the Philippines. It mandates government agencies to adopt a zero-contact policy, set up a unified business application form, establish a central business portal, and implement a national single window system. It also imposes strict deadlines and penalties for government officials who cause delays or violate the law[^2^].
- The Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act 10173) â this is a law that aims to protect the privacy and security of personal data collected, processed, stored, and shared by individuals and organizations. It requires data controllers and processors to comply with certain principles, obligations, and rights regarding data privacy. It also establishes the National Privacy Commission as the regulatory body that oversees the implementation and enforcement of the law[^3^].
- The Philippine Competition Act (Republic Act 10667) â this is a law that aims to promote fair and free competition in trade, industry, and commerce. It prohibits anti-competitive agreements, abuse of dominant position, and mergers and acquisitions that substantially prevent, restrict, or lessen competition. It also creates the Philippine Competition Commission as the independent quasi-judicial body that investigates, adjudicates, and imposes sanctions for violations of the law.

These are some of the business laws in the Philippines that entrepreneurs should be familiar with. By knowing these laws, they can ensure that they are doing business legally and ethically, as well as take advantage of the opportunities and benefits that these laws provide.
