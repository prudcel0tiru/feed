YUI is not only a talented performer, but also a prolific songwriter and composer. She writes all of her songs by herself, drawing inspiration from her personal experiences, emotions and observations. She also plays various instruments, such as acoustic guitar, electric guitar, bass guitar, piano and drums. She is known for her distinctive voice, which can be soft and sweet or powerful and rockish depending on the song. She is also praised for her honest and heartfelt lyrics, which resonate with many listeners.
 
YUI started her music career in 2004, when she was discovered by a Sony Music Japan staff member at an audition in her hometown of Fukuoka. She moved to Tokyo to pursue her dream of becoming a singer, and released her debut single "Feel My Soul" in 2005. She gained more popularity with her second single "Tomorrow's Way", which was used as the theme song for the movie Hinokio. Her third single "Life" was chosen as the ending theme for the anime Bleach, exposing her to a wider audience.
 
In 2006, YUI starred in the movie Taiyou no Uta (Song of the Sun) as Amane Kaoru, a girl who suffers from a rare skin disease that prevents her from going out in the sun. She also sang the theme song "Good-bye Days" and other songs for the movie under the name YUI for Amane Kaoru. The movie was a box office hit and earned YUI several awards, including Best Newcomer at the Japan Academy Awards. Her first album From Me to You was also released in 2006 and reached number one on the Oricon charts.

YUI continued to release hit singles and albums in the following years, such as "Rolling Star", "Love & Truth", "Again", "It's All Too Much/Never Say Die" and "Rain". She also collaborated with other artists, such as Stereopony, Aqua Timez and Judy and Mary. She won several awards for her music, such as the Japan Record Award for Best Song of the Year in 2007 for "Love & Truth", the Japan Gold Disc Award for Rock Album of the Year in 2008 for Can't Buy My Love, and the MTV Video Music Award Japan for Best Female Video in 2010 for "Again". She also performed at various music festivals and events, such as the Fuji Rock Festival, the MTV Unplugged series and the NHK Kouhaku Uta Gassen.
 
In 2012, YUI announced that she would take a hiatus from her solo career and form a new band called Flower Flower. She explained that she wanted to challenge herself with a different style of music and express herself more freely. She also wanted to have a more normal life and interact with people more. Flower Flower debuted in 2013 and released their first album Mi in 2014. The band's music is more experimental and alternative than YUI's solo work, incorporating elements of rock, folk, electronic and jazz. YUI also changed her stage name to yui (lowercase) to reflect her new identity.
